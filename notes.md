1. Inside div#content, create a homepage for your restaurant. You might want to include an image, headline, and some text about how wonderful the restaurant is; you do not have to make this look too fancy. It’s okay to hard-code these into the HTML for now just to see how they look on the page.

DONE: Now step 2

2. Now remove everything inside div#content from the HTML (so you still have the <header> and <nav> with an empty <div id="content"> below it) and instead create them by using JavaScript only, e.g. by appending each new element to div#content once the page is first loaded. Since we’re all set up to write our code in multiple files, let’s write this initial page-load function inside of its own module and then import and call it inside of index.js.

So, steps:
[x] Create basic JS file
[x] Add DOM functionality
[x] Move to function
[x] ChatGPT re DOM ready, DOM load, different advice
[x] Ask re factory functions
[x] Done

All done, now moving to:

[x] Next, set up your restaurant site to use tabbed browsing to access the Menu and Contact pages. Look at the behavior of this student’s live preview site for visual inspiration.

[x] Put the contents of each “tab” inside of its own module. Each module will export a function that creates a div element, adds the appropriate content and styles to that element and then appends it to the DOM.

[x] Write the tab-switching logic inside of index.js. You should have event listeners for each button in the header navbar that wipes out the current contents of div#content and then runs the correct ‘tab module’ to populate it with the new contents again.

To implement point 2, we’ll separate the content generation (which remains in each module) from the rendering logic (which will stay entirely in index.js). This approach keeps each module focused only on preparing content while index.js manages clearing and inserting content into the DOM.

1. Update Each Module to Only Generate Content
Each module will now only create and return a content element (a div or other HTML element) without appending it to the DOM. Here’s how you could modify home.js:

javascript
Copy code
// home.js
import pageImage from "../assets/langostinos.png";

const createHomePage = () => {
    const container = document.createElement('div');
    container.classList.add('home-content'); // Adding a class for styling purposes

    const h1 = document.createElement('h1');
    h1.textContent = 'Porta Tapas - Manchester';
    container.appendChild(h1);

    const paragraph1 = document.createElement('p');
    paragraph1.textContent = 'The menu represents many tapas bar classics, with additional daily specials. Our team of chefs prepare everything from scratch using top-quality ingredients imported from some of the very best producers in Spain.';
    container.appendChild(paragraph1);

    const paragraph2 = document.createElement('p');
    paragraph2.textContent = 'Simply put, Porta is the kind of place to relax in - unpretentious and comfortable with good music, beer, wine, and food.';
    container.appendChild(paragraph2);

    const image = document.createElement('img');
    image.src = pageImage;
    container.appendChild(image);

    return container; // Return the fully prepared element, without appending it to the DOM
};

export default createHomePage;
Now, createHomePage only returns the fully prepared div without handling any DOM insertion. Repeat similar adjustments for menu.js and about.js.

2. Refactor index.js for Clear Separation of Logic
Now that each module only provides content, index.js will be responsible for clearing and rendering content in div#content. This helps keep your code modular and scalable. Here’s what index.js might look like:

javascript
Copy code
import "./css/style.css";

import createHomePage from './js/home.js';
import createMenuPage from './js/menu.js';
import createAboutPage from './js/about.js';

function pageRendering() {
    const clearPage = () => {
        const container = document.getElementById('content');
        while (container.firstChild) {
            container.removeChild(container.firstChild);
        }
    };

    const renderPage = (contentElement) => {
        const container = document.getElementById('content');
        container.appendChild(contentElement);
    };

    const buttonListeners = () => {
        document.body.addEventListener('click', async (e) => {
            if (e.target.classList.contains('btn')) {
                clearPage();
                
                const pageId = e.target.id;
                if (pageId === 'home') {
                    renderPage(createHomePage());
                } else if (pageId === 'menu') {
                    const { default: createMenuPage } = await import('./js/menu.js');
                    renderPage(createMenuPage());
                } else if (pageId === 'about') {
                    const { default: createAboutPage } = await import('./js/about.js');
                    renderPage(createAboutPage());
                }
            }
        });
    };

    return { buttonListeners };
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    renderPage(createHomePage()); // Render the homepage on initial load
    pageRendering().buttonListeners();    
});
Explanation of Changes
clearPage(): Clears the current contents of div#content, as before.

renderPage(contentElement):

This new function takes a DOM element (e.g., the div returned by createHomePage), then appends it to div#content. It centralizes all DOM appending in one place, making the rendering logic clearer.
Event Listener Logic:

The buttonListeners() function now calls renderPage() with the correct content element depending on the button clicked. Each module is imported and only supplies the content, while the renderPage() function handles the actual insertion into the DOM.
Why This Structure Improves Modularity and Efficiency
Encapsulation: Each module now only defines what content should appear, without needing to know how or when it’s displayed. This separation of concerns makes it easier to update each module without affecting rendering logic.

Scalability: By centralizing DOM manipulation in renderPage, future adjustments to the rendering process (such as adding animations or effects) can be handled in one place.

This structure improves your code’s clarity and sets you up for easier scalability and future updates! Let me know if you'd like further details on any part of this refactoring approach.
